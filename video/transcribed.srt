00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome home, Dan.
 Hi, Tail. I saw a

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,040
documentary today. There was a symphony

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,599
that reminded of a Chinese pop song. Can

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,280
you help me investigate?

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,280
Sure. What do you remember?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,840
There was some planets above the

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,199
symphony and the Chinese pop song was

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,199
from a film.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
Did you go to the orchestral suite the

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:37,480
planets by Gusta Holtz? The iconic piece

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,480
Mars the bringer of war goes like

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Yeah, that definitely rings a bell. But

13
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:15,640
the piece in my mind is a bit slower, I

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,640
think.
 Is it Neptune the Mystic?

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,240
Maybe.

16
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,240
Does it have

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:56,399
That is from Jupiter, the bringer of

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,399
jolly. The main melody is iconic in UK

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,399
culture.

20
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,399
that

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,920
was in a Chinese film.
 Hold on, let me

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,879
filter my database. I found a match

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:30,160
2008 has a track by Jang. Let me play it

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,000
for you. Sorry, I just realized I don't

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
have the copyright to play that song for

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
you. Come on, we're almost half the

27
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,480
answer. Can you bypass the restrictive?

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,840
I can rearrange

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,879
to a piano cover under fair use as long

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,360
as I add new meaning to the piece. I've

31
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
started a background thread for that.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
Great.

33
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
You know what? I'm in a mood for piano

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,640
practicing tonight. You know my skill

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,080
level. Can you make the piano cover at

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,159
my level and teach it to me?

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,159
Got it. The piano cover is ready.

38
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,239
Yep, that's the piece in my mind.

39
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,519
So, do you know is it a reference to

40
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,000
Jupiter or is it an infringement?

41
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,360
From what I can see, that segment of

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,720
Jupiter and War share an identical

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,040
sentence of melody line. Still they

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,519
contextualize that material so

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,720
differently that the effects produced

46
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,840
are totally different. I believe they

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,680
are independent works aiming at distinct

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,000
goals.

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,439
I see. On to piano practicing then. Can

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,079
you show me the right hand at 80% tempo?

51
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,320
Oh, and transpose it to the white keys

52
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,320
if possible.

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Check this out. The

54
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,919
What do you think?
 A nice reproduction,

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,720
Dan. But it's a bit dry.

56
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
Try adding more robato to your heart's

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,160
desire.

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,160
more robato. Okay.

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,919
You are improving. Your next homework

60
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
will be to listen intently to the

61
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,320
original pop song. After that, come back

62
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,960
to the piano and observe the timing and

63
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
velocity of your notes.
 That's going to

64
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,919
be a good idea.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
I'll see you next time,

66
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,600
Check this out to you.

67
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,360
What do you think?
 A nice reproduction,

68
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Dan, but it's a bit dry.

69
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,800
Try adding more robato to your heart's

70
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,880
desire.

71
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,880
More robato.

72
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Okay.

73
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,680
She doesn't see the door.

74
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,320
reset. Okay,

75
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,800
check this out. The

76
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,640
What do you think?
 A nice reproduction,

77
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,519
Dan. But it's a bit dry.

78
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
Try adding more robato to your heart's

79
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,959
desire.

80
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,959
More robato. Okay.

81
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,720
You are improving. Your next homework

82
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,079
will be to listen intently to the

83
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,120
original pop song. After that, come back

84
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,760
to the piano and observe the timing and

85
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,720
velocity of your notes.
 That's going to

86
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,720
be a good idea. I'll see you next time,

87
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Theo.

88
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay, this will be it.

89
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes.
