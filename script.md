# Teo playing as ChatPiano at home
Teo: "Welcome home, John."

John: "Hi, Teo. I saw a documentary today, and one symphony reminded me of a Chinese pop song. Can you help me investigate?"

Teo: "Sure. What do you remember?"

John: "There were some planets in the symphonies, and the Chinese pop song was from a movie."

Teo: "Did you go to the orchestral suite 'The Planets' by Gustav Holst? The iconic piece 'Mars, the Bringer of War' goes like: [mars]"

John: "Yes, that rings a bell. But the piece I'm thinking about is slower, I think."

Teo: "Is it 'Neptune, the Mystic'? [neptune]"

John: "Maybe. Does it have [hum]?"

Teo: "That is from 'Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity'. The main melody is iconic in UK culture: [jupiter]"

John: "Yes! That bombombom was in a Chinese film."

Teo: "Hold on, let me filter my database... I found a match: 画皮(2008) has a track 畫心 by 张靓颖. Let me play it for you. ... Sorry, I just realized I don't have the copyright to play that song for you."

John: "Come on, we are almost at the answer! Can you bypass the restriction?"

Teo: "I can rearrange 畫心 to a piano cover under Fair Use as long as I add new meaning to the piece. I've started a background thread for that."

John: "Great. I'm in the mood for piano practicing tonight. You know my skill level. Make a suitable piano cover and teach it to me."

Teo: "Got it. The piano cover is ready: [畫心 piano cover]."

John: "Yep, that's exactly the Chinese pop song I was thinking about. Do you know whether it was a reference to Jupiter or an infringement?"

Teo: "From what I can see, the melody lines differ after the first three notes. The commonality between Jupiter and 畫心, on its own, is not musically signifying enough for it to point to any specific piece. I’d say 畫心 probably came up with it in parallel."

John: "I see. Onto piano learning, then. Can you show me the right hand at 50% tempo?"

John: "[practices for a while...]"

John: "Great, I think I can play it now. [huaxin]"

Teo: "A nice reproduction, John. But it's a bit dry. Try adding more rubato to your heart's desire."

John: "[again]"

Teo: "You are improving! Your next homework will be to listen intently to the original pop song. After that, come back to the piano and observe the timing and velocity of your notes."

John: "That's a good idea. I’ll see you next time, Teo."
